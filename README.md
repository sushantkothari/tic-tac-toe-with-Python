# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe in Python, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. Players will compete against a computer-controlled opponent that randomly selects its moves. The game provides a "Restart Game" feature allowing players to start a new game at any point.

## Features

- Graphical user interface for easy gameplay.
- Compete against a computer-controlled opponent.
- Ability to restart the game at any point.

## Installation

To run this game, you'll need Python installed on your computer. Python 3.6 or higher is recommended. You can download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-with-Python.git
cd tic-tac-toe
```

## How to Play

Run the game from the command line:

```
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

## Game Rules
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
You are 'O', and the computer is 'X'. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
